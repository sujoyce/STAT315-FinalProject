Private rooms are the second cheapest on average, but also have a high price variation. However, shared rooms are on average the cheapest and are relatively consistent in price, especially compared to other room types. In contrast, hotel rooms are on average the most expensive, but have the most consistent price rates. Most importantly, it is important to observe how the majority of our price variation occurs in entire homes/apartments and private rooms.

        "For our last exploratory analysis, we wanted to explore the pricing distribution on a geo-spatial level. First, we noticed that most of our more expensive lisitngs were centralized around the \"downtown\" Austin area, with cheaper rentals dispersed across less \"touristy\" areas. From this heat map, we also observed some gapping throughout unexpected areas. This left us wondering how proximity to recreational attractions may affect price and rental locations. So, we were able to obtain coordinates of popular attractions in Austin and overlay them on our map. This did potentially explain some of our observed trends, including the gapping, as some attractions are on private land that typically do not host Airbnbs. For example, the University of Texas and the Texas State Capitol are not available for Airbnbs due to the presence of student housing and ownership by the state. It makes sense that many renters are willing to pay more to be as close as possible to the city's attractions, so Airbnb hosts listing as close as possible to them are seemingly pricing these properties higher on average than those that are further away (for example, Mount Bonnell)."

        "In order to get a better understanding about how our factors impacted price we trained two models, linear regression and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We used a k-folds cross validation approach to training both models in order to get a stable estimate of their respecitve performances. In order to have a fair comparison we also made sure to train both models on identical feature sets. We used GridSearchCV in order to test a wide array of hyperparameters for the MLP models as well as preparing the factors, but both the MLP and the linear regression failed to get RMSE's of less than 600. Running a variable importance plot we found that latitude and longitude were the most important features especially for the MLP. We attempted to make this location information more interpretable and increase model performance by finding the coordinates for downtown Austin as defined by Apple Maps and finding the distance from each listing and encoding it as 'distance_to_center'. This led to a dramatic improvement for our models in terms of RMSE. After this success we decided to find more landmarks in Austin area and encode the distance of listings from them in their own factors. Since many landmarks are close together it made sense to create clusters of landmarks and to only record the minimum distance from each listing to one of the locations in that cluster. This, however, only led to a moderate improvement in model performance. The MLP ended up with a RMSE of 159.98. The standard deviation for prices in general were 195.71 which means our model is superior to estimating all airbnb prices with the mean but only somewhat."

        "Looking at our final variable importance plot from our MLP model we see that the most important features almost all relate to distance. This was expected as location is commonly seen as the most important aspect about real estate. What was suprising however, was how distance to South Congress cluster was more important than distance to downtown cluster. We had expected the distance to downtown cluster to be the most important. Somewhat unsurprisingly, distance to north west cluster was considered of little importance to predicting price. This suggests that proximity to Mount Bonnell is unimportant to most consumers in determining what they are willing to pay for an Airbnb. The most important non-location factor was reviews_per_month. This also makes sense, as having a lot of reviews suggests that consumers on average are more willing to trust the hosts and the listing is more of a hot spot.\n",

        "The RMSE of our linear regression model was 171.28. This means that on average, we are about \\$171.27 away from predicting the right price. While it is inferior in terms of our MLP model, we expected it to perform much worse. Initially before our feature engineering, the RMSE of the linear regression model was much worse than for our MLP model. This suggests that in the course of creating new and simpler features from more complicated ones such as longitude and latitude,  we essentially are able to see a more linear relationship between our factors and the response. This is one of the limitations of the linear regression model: the data may not be linear. In addition, our estimates may be unstable since some of the features could be highly correlated. The biggest limitation is that this model does not show us which features are significant. Thus, we need to do further analysis."

Thus, we suggest that travelers who are wanting to save money should book listings that are farther from the main hotspots of Austin: Downtown, South Congress, and Zilker Park. Furthermore, highly affluent neighborhoods may also be more expensive than those that are poorer. Finally, travelers who book for listings that are not shared can expect to spend more money."
